1. Using the momentum decile assignments from Exercise 1C, compute the **cumulative return** of each decile portfolio from January 2021 through January 2026. Assume equal-weighted monthly rebalancing.
2. Plot the cumulative returns of all 10 decile portfolios on a single chart (use a log scale for the y-axis).
3. Compute and report the **annualized Sharpe ratio** of each decile portfolio (assume a risk-free rate of zero for simplicity).
4. What is the annualized mean return and Sharpe ratio of the **long-short** portfolio (Decile 10 minus Decile 1)?
