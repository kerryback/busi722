Using the monthly out-of-sample predictions:

1. **Long-only top decile:** Each month, equal-weight the stocks in the top predicted decile. Compute monthly portfolio returns.
2. **Long-short D10 - D1:** Each month, go long the top decile (equal-weight) and short the bottom decile (equal-weight). Compute monthly returns.
3. **Top quintile vs. top decile:** Compare the long-only top-quintile portfolio to the top-decile portfolio.
4. For each portfolio, report: mean monthly return, annualized volatility, annualized Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown.
5. Plot the cumulative returns of all three portfolios on a single chart.
