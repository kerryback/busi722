Using Claude Code and the `fetch-returns` skill, fetch monthly returns data for all stocks from January 2021 through January 2026. The skill will query the SEP and DAILY tables, compute returns and momentum, and assign size categories.

1. Report the total number of rows, unique tickers, and date range.
2. How many rows are lost when you apply the penny-stock filter (drop rows with `close` < \$5)?
3. What fraction of stock-months have missing `momentum`? In a markdown cell, explain why momentum is missing for early observations.
