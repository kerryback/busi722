#### Overview

The topic of this course is selecting stocks based on quantitative signals.  What we want to do is to predict  which stocks will do better than others.  In quantitative investing, this is often done using machine learning, which means fitting a model to predict returns from signals.  Even subjective things like the tone of the CEO in an earnings call are quantifiable today.  Thus, quantitative investing includes a large part of equity investing. 

Many different types of data are used for constructing trading signals.  In this course, we will  use past returns and data from corporate financial statements.  Textual analysis of corporate filings and news reports, social media activity, web traffic, insider trades, short sales, analyst forecasts, satellite imagery, and other types of data are also often used in practice. 

Many studies have been published on the effectiveness of different quantitative signals for predicting stock returns.  We will discuss those studies throughout the course and use them to guide our construction of signals.  

#### Data and Tools

We will use data from the [Rice Business Data Portal](https:/data-portal.rice-business.org), and we will work with it in Python with the help of Anthropic's Claude Code.  We need the Pro account ($20/month).  You will be reimbursed at the end of the course for two months usage.  Instructions on installing and using Claude Code will be provided in the class.
