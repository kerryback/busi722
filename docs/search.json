Howard Creekmore Professor of Finance and Professor of Economics kerryback@gmail.com\n\n\n\nRoom 317, McNair Hall TTh 10:50 – 12:05 1/8/2024 – 2/23/2024\n\n\n\nThe first half of the course will cover options and futures for risk management and investing. We’ll explain what the securities are and how they trade, how they are used in risk management and investments, and how to value them. The second half of the course will be devoted to active portfolio management and specifically factor investing. We will review the historical results of factor investing and study how to optimally combine factors using machine learning techniques. We will analyze the results in the way that endowments and other institutions evaluate investment managers. We’ll do a real-world implementation of our models with paper trading via the python API at Alpaca Brokerage.\n\n\n\nGrades will be based on a group project, weekly assignments, and a final exam. The group project will account for 20% of the course grade, the assignments for 40%, and the final exam for 40%. The final exam will cover only options and futures. It will be distributed on Feb 22 and due on Feb 27. The group project is due April 23.\n\n\n\nGroups should consist of two or three students. The project is to implement a 140/40 portfolio strategy at Alpaca brokerage, using their python API for paper trading. The portfolio should be 100% long in SPY and 40% long-short with the longs and shorts based on return predictions from a machine learning model. Each group should submit a pdf describing their investment strategy and an evaluation of their results. The strategy should be implemented by Friday, Feb 23. It should be rebalanced weekly, and results should be reported through Friday, Apr 12. The write-up should include an analysis of the weekly returns relative to the weekly returns of SPY.\n\n\n\n\nOptions and their uses\nOption spreads\nOption valuation\nIntroduction to futures\nSpot-futures parity\nRisk-management case\nFactor investing\nBacktesting\nBacktesting machine learning models\nStrategy evaluation\nIndustries and sectors\nAlpaca API\nRebalancing\n\n\n\n\nThe Rice University honor code applies to all work in this course. Each student must do his or her own assignments, but it is allowed and in fact encouraged for students to seek advice from each other.\n\n\n\nAny student with a documented disability requiring accommodations in this course is encouraged to contact me outside of class. All discussions will remain confidential. Any adjustments or accommodations regarding assignments or the final exam must be made in advance.

Quantitative equity investing is using quantifiable signals to select stocks via algorithms. We’ll explore machine learning methods to predict returns, and we will backtest trading strategies based on the signals. We will analyze the results in the way that endowments and other institutions evaluate investment managers. We’ll do a real-world implementation of our models with paper trading via the python API at Alpaca Brokerage.\nThe second half of the course will be spent on options and futures. Options and futures are important instruments for risk management and also for investing.

Propose a costless (or, rather, near costless) collar. Plot the value of your collared stock, net of any income/expense for the collar, as a function of the stock price at the options maturity.\nSuppose you don’t own the stock but want to make a bet on it. Propose a bull spread. Plot your profit or loss on the spread as a function of the stock price if you hold it to maturity. The profit or loss should be as a percent of the cost of the spread.\nAssume you want to bet against the stock and repeat #2 for a bear spread.\nRepeat #2 for a straddle. What are you betting on with a straddle?\nRepeat #2 for a butterfly spread. What are you betting on with a butterfly spread?\nConsider the 140 call and put. What is the “PV of strike” that is consistent with put-call parity?"
