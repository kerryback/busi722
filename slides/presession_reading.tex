\begin{frame}{The Goal}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use data to generate \alert{quantitative signals} that predict which stocks will outperform.
\item Combine signals using machine learning, build portfolios, backtest, and evaluate performance.
\item This course: use AI (Claude Code) to do all of the above.
\end{itemize}

%%% PART 1A: PREDICTORS FROM PAST RETURNS %%%

\begin{frame}[c]

\Huge Predictors from Past Returns
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Momentum}
\begin{itemize}
\item Jegadeesh \& Titman (1993): buy stocks with high past 3--12 month returns, sell stocks with low past returns.
\item One of the most robust anomalies in finance---documented across countries, asset classes, and time periods.
\item Typical implementation: sort on cumulative return from $t{-}12$ to $t{-}2$ (skip the most recent month to avoid short-term reversal).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Time-Series Momentum}
\begin{itemize}
\item Moskowitz, Ooi \& Pedersen (2012): go long assets with positive past 12-month returns, short those with negative past returns.
\item Differs from cross-sectional momentum: each asset is compared to \alert{its own past}, not to other assets.
\item Works across equities, bonds, commodities, and currencies---related to trend-following strategies used by managed futures funds.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Moving Averages}
\begin{itemize}
\item SMA (simple moving average) and EMA (exponential moving average) smooth price series over a window.
\item \textbf{200-day rule} (Faber 2007): buy when price is above its 200-day MA, sell when below. Brock, Lakonishok \& LeBaron (1992) found strong support for MA rules in the DJIA.
\item Zhu \& Zhou (2009) provided theoretical justification: MAs optimally combine momentum signals at different horizons.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Trend Factor}
\begin{itemize}
\item Han, Zhou \& Zhu (2016): combine short-, medium-, and long-term moving averages into a single trend signal.
\item Earns large risk-adjusted returns that are not explained by standard factors.
\item Performs well during crises when standard momentum crashes.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Reversals}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Short-term reversal:} last month's losers outperform next month (Lehmann 1990, Jegadeesh 1990). Driven by liquidity provision and overreaction.
\item \textbf{Long-term reversal:} 3--5 year past winners underperform (DeBondt \& Thaler 1985). Consistent with investor overreaction and mean reversion.
\item Together with momentum, these define the \alert{complete horizon structure} of return predictability:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 month: reversal
\item 2--12 months: momentum
\item 3--5 years: reversal
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{52-Week High}
\begin{itemize}
\item George \& Hwang (2004): nearness to 52-week high (current price / 52-week high) predicts future returns.
\item Outperforms standard momentum as a predictor and profits do not reverse.
\item Behavioral explanation: \alert{anchoring bias}---investors use the 52-week high as a reference point and underreact when price approaches it.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Other Technical Indicators}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{RSI} (Relative Strength Index): overbought above 70, oversold below 30. Mean-reversion signal.
\item \textbf{MACD} (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): difference between short and long EMAs; signal line crossovers indicate trend changes.
\item Widely used by practitioners, but limited top-journal academic support for out-of-sample profitability.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Volatility}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Low-volatility anomaly:} stocks with low historical volatility earn higher \alert{risk-adjusted} returns than high-volatility stocks---contradicting the basic CAPM risk--return tradeoff.
\item Ang, Hodrick, Xing \& Zhang (2006) documented the effect for idiosyncratic volatility.
\item Explanations: leverage constraints, lottery preferences, benchmarking by institutional investors.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%% PART 1B: PREDICTORS FROM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS %%%

\begin{frame}[c]
\centering
\Huge Predictors from Financial Statements
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Value}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Book-to-market:} Fama \& French (1992) documented that high B/M stocks (``value'') outperform low B/M stocks (``growth'').
\item Other value ratios---earnings yield (Basu 1977) and cash flow yield (Lakonishok, Shleifer \& Vishny 1994)---tell a similar story.
\item Common theme: stocks with high ratios of fundamental value to market price tend to outperform.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Profitability}
\begin{itemize}
\item Novy-Marx (2013): gross profit / assets is a strong predictor of returns. ROE and operating margins also predict.
\item More profitable firms earn higher returns, especially when combined with value.
\item Fama \& French (2015) added profitability and investment factors to their three-factor model.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Growth \& Investment}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Asset growth:} Cooper, Gulen \& Schill (2008) showed firms that grow assets aggressively tend to \alert{underperform}. High capital expenditure similarly predicts lower returns.
\item This is the \alert{investment anomaly}: empire-building firms destroy shareholder value.
\item Consistent with overinvestment by managers or diminishing returns to capital.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Quality \& Accruals}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Accruals anomaly} (Sloan 1996): firms with high accruals (earnings far above cash flow) underperform. Cash-based earnings are more persistent.
\item \textbf{Quality Minus Junk} (Asness, Frazzini \& Pedersen 2019): composite of profitability, growth, safety, and payout. Related signals include earnings stability, low leverage, and high payout ratios.
\item Quality stocks earn higher returns despite being ``safer''---another puzzle for standard asset pricing.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%% PART 1C: OTHER PREDICTORS %%%

\begin{frame}[c]
\centering
\Huge Other Predictors
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Short Interest}
\begin{itemize}
\item Heavily shorted stocks tend to underperform (Desai et al.\ 2002, Rapach, Ringgenberg \& Zhou 2016). Aggregate short interest also forecasts market-level returns.
\item Short interest reflects \alert{informed pessimistic opinions}: short sellers face costs (borrowing fees, margin, unlimited loss potential), so they act only on strong convictions.
\item Constraints on short selling limit the speed of price adjustment to negative information.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Insider Trades}
\begin{itemize}
\item Insider purchases predict positive future returns (Lakonishok \& Lee 2001, Jeng, Metrick \& Zeckhauser 2003). Sales are less informative---insiders sell for many reasons.
\item Insiders have an \alert{informational advantage} about their own firms' prospects.
\item SEC filings (Form 4) make insider trades public, typically within two business days.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Earnings Announcements}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD):} one of the oldest documented anomalies (Ball \& Brown 1968, Bernard \& Thomas 1989). Prices drift in the direction of the surprise for weeks or months.
\item \textbf{Standardized unexpected earnings (SUE):} (actual $-$ expected) / standard deviation. Higher SUE predicts higher future returns.
\item Explanation: investors underreact to earnings news and update beliefs too slowly.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Analyst Revisions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Changes in analyst earnings estimates and price targets predict returns: upward revisions are followed by positive returns, downward by negative.
\item Information from analyst revisions is incorporated into prices slowly, similar to PEAD.
\item Analysts aggregate information from multiple sources, making revisions a useful summary signal.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%% WHAT WE WILL USE %%%

\begin{frame}{What We Will Use}
\begin{itemize}
\item This course focuses on signals from \textbf{past returns} and \textbf{financial statements}, available in the Rice Business stock market database.
\item We will construct signals like momentum, moving averages, book-to-market, profitability ratios, and more directly from the database.
\item The methods we develop (sorting, Fama-MacBeth regression, machine learning, backtesting) apply equally to any signal source.
\end{itemize}
